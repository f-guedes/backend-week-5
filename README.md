		/*
		 * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
		 * Four Pillars of OOP:
		 * 	1. Abstraction
		 * 	2. Encapsulation
		 * 	3. Inheritance
		 * 	4. Polymorphism
		 * 
		 * In OOP we structure our code using Classes
		 * Class is like a blueprint
		 * Object is the actual product built from the blueprint
		 * An object is an instance of a Class
